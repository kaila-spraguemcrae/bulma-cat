        <p>She can often be found...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>napping</li>
            <li>eating</li>
            <li>and pooping</li>
        </ul>
        <p>However she has many poop problems</p>

        <p><b>BULMA</b>, the god of eveything, can also be found licking her belly.
        <br>She likes a good clean belly</br></p>
        <p>Bulma once told me "With hair on the belly, there is no way to be a good animal. A good animal is a bald animal on the belly. In order for me to be the God of all things, I have to regularly ensure that my belly has no hair". I thought long about this and realized that Bulma must be right about everything.</p>
